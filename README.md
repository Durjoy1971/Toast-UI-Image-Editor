### 4. 🧩 Open Source Libraries Used & Customization

- **Toast UI Image Editor**: Core editing tool; heavily customized with a unique theme.
- **Fabric.js** (via CDN): Powers canvas manipulation (internally used by Toast UI).
- **Toast UI Color Picker / Code Snippet** (via CDN): Used for color UI and helper functions.
- **FileSaver.js** (via CDN): Used for saving/exporting edited images.
- **Customization Highlights**:
  - Custom UI styling and icons via the `customTheme` object in `app.js`.
  - Color palette, button styling, and icon overrides for consistency with branding.

### 5. ⏱️ Task Estimation

- **Estimated time (without AI):** 4 to 6 working days
  This includes understanding Toast UI basics, setting up the environment, customizing the theme, and testing all core features.
- **Estimated time with AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT):** 2 to 3 working days
  AI assistance can speed up setup, provide code examples, clarify API usage, and help troubleshoot errors more quickly.

### ⚠️ Challenges

1. **Toast UI Customization**: Documentation is somewhat scattered; deep theme customization is hard without source reading.
2. **CDN Debugging**: Conflicts between local and CDN scripts (e.g., version mismatch).
3. **NPM Tooling**: A beginner might struggle with `npm`, `live-server`, and proper module resolution.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Toast UI breaks backward compatibility often. AI tools like Copilot/ChatGPT may hallucinate outdated APIs. **Always cross-check with the official docs.**

### 6. 🧠 Potential AI Hallucinations / Debugging Notes

| Area                | Possible Issue                                                                                | Debugging Tip                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toast UI API        | AI may reference deprecated or incorrect methods (e.g., `.loadImageFromFile` vs newer method) | Always verify method names in Toast UI docs.                              |
| Theme Customization | Copilot may ignore valid `customTheme` properties or confuse them with CSS variables          | Check the full shape of the `theme` object from official theme API        |
| CDN Library Loading | AI may not warn about script loading order conflicts                                          | Always load dependencies like Fabric.js first, then Toast UI, then app.js |
| FileSaver.js Usage  | AI may hallucinate `saveAs()` usage without checking the blob type                            | Check browser compatibility and MIME type when exporting                  |
